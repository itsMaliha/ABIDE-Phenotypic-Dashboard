 For a project, I have recently started working on the ABIDE dataset (ABIDE-I's preprocessed CCS) to be exact and for data explo,ration I thought it would be great to create a small dashboard just to identify the distribution of the data. Before we move forward here is a little about the ABIDE dataset. You can read more about it over at their website at (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)

<h2>What is ABIDE?</h2>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by qualitative impairment in social rciprocity, and by repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviors/interests. Previously considered rare, ASD is now recognized to occur in more than 1% of children. Despite continuing research advances, their pace and clinical impact have not kept up with the urgency to identify ways of determining the diagnosis at earlier ages, selecting optimal treatments, and predicting outcomes. For the, most part this is due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD. To face these challenges, large-scale samples are essential, but single laboratories cannot obtain sufficiently large datasets to reveal the brain mechanisms underlying ASD. In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative has aggregated functional and structural brain imaging data collected from laboratories around the world to accelerate our understanding of the neural bases of autism. With the ultimate goal of facilitating discovery science and comparisons across samples, the ABIDE initiative now includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II. Each collection was created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories and are being made available to investigators throughout the world, consistent with open science principles, such as those at the core of the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative.

<h2>ABIDE-I Preprocessed</h2>
A consortium of the InternationData-sharingging Datasharing Initiative (INDI), ABIDE is a collaboration of 16 international imaging sites that have aggregated and are openly sharing neuroimaging data from 539 individuals suffering from ASD and 573 typical controls. These 1112 datasets are composed of resting state functional MRI data along with an extensive array of phenotypic information.

Data from ABIDE was preprocessed by five different teams using their preferred tools. Functional preprocessing was performed using: the Connectome Computation System (CCS), the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of and Connectomes (CPAC), the Data Processing Assistant for Resting,-State fMRI (DPARSF) and the NeuroImaging Analysis Kit. Due to the controversies surrounding bandpass filtering and global signal regression, four different preprocessing strategies were performed with each pipeline: all combinations of with and without filtering and with and without global signal correction. To limit the variance between outputs to just preprocessing, statistical derivatives for each pipeline and strategy were calculated by the CPAC software. Structural preprocessing and calculation owereortical measures were performed using three different pipelines: ANTS, CIVET, and FreeSurfer. Refer to the links at the top for more information about the different pipelines and derivatives.

By HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
By openly sharing a wide range of preprocessed data and derivatives, the Neuro Bureau Preprocessing Initiative seeks to make neuroimaging research accessible to a wider audience of researchers. It has already enabled computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians who lack neuroimaging expertise to develop and test novel data analysis strategies. We see several important benefits to our initiative: (1) facilitate the generation and test of novel hypotheses about brain function, (2) provide a resource to train future generations ,of neuroimaging researchers and, (3) facilitate the replication of published results by providing a benchmark set of test images. By providing a breadth of derivatives and preprocessing strategies, we also hope to establish a platform for comparing their relative merits, as well as testing the robustness of neuroscientific findings. This already broad resource will soon be enhanced by the inclusion of the phenotypically rich ABIDE dataset which consists of data from an important clinical population.  

<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
The data was downloaded using nilearphenotypicere we received this phenptypic file. I have attached it here in this repository as well. Because we want to predict between two classes, Autism and Typical Control mfocuindicatorender and age, a key indicators of Autism diagnosis. For this reason, you will find this dashboard to be fairly clean and simple in its approach to displaying information. I used Power BI fgo-toeating this dashboard, my go to tool when ,it comes to interactive visuals and have attached the file in this repository as well.

Here is an overview of what the dashboard looks like.
